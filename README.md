<h1>The Nand2Tetris project</h1>

<h3>in this project we implemented projects 7-11 from <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">nand2tetris</a></h3>
<br/>
in our course, "principles of software languages" we did projects 7-11 in diferent languages.    
We implemented the projects with dart programing language.    
I really loved this course, definitely one of the best.
